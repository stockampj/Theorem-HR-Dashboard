Overview:
We'd like there to be a portal for employees to be able to submit suggestions and/or complains to HR (Tim). Should have a notification feature where it'll alert Tim via email that there is a submission awaiting review/response within the HR portal.

Additional feature (bonus):
We'd also like there to be an option for users to post suggestions/complains privately or post it to a general board.

Timeline: 3 weeks

This will be in another droplet/subdomain under the theoremadvertising.com domain - I can get that setup after you're completed so don't worry about that ðŸ™‚


specs:

submit suggestions/complaints to db
notification when new db
flag resolved/not-resolved
private/public flag
individual users
auth
